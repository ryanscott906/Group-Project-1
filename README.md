# CryptoStock

## Overview

CryptoStock is an application available on the user's browser. This application displays a companies current market share data (in USD) and its value in the selected cryptocurrency.

Upon loading the application CryptoStock presents a table with five of the best-performing companies in the world along with their current price per share, the volume of shares, and their value in cryptocurrency. When the user searches a company via the search bar at the top of the page, the respective information for that company is prepended to the table.

## Future Development

- Allow user searches to be stored locally on their web browser
- Allow users the option to convert company shares into other cryptocurrencies in addition to Bitcoin (Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.)
- User can search by company name in addition to company stock exchange symbol
